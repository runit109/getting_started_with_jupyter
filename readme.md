# Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks

# What is a Jupyter Notebook?

A Jupyter Notebook is an open-source, server-client application that allows editing and running computer code and rich text elements via a web browser. A notebook has a kernel which operates as the compute engine that executes the code and produces the results. The kernel is automatically launched when the notebook is executed. The name Jupyter comes from the supported programming languages that it supports: Julia, Python, and R. 

# What are Jupyter Notebooks used for?

Jupyter Notebooks are being used as online notebooks, letting faculty and students work together on code with text, multimedia, and graphs. Faculty can use it to set up interactive textbooks, full of explanations and examples which students can test out right from their browsers. Students can use it to explain their reasoning, show their work, and draw connections between their classwork and the world. Scientists, journalists, and researchers can use it to open up their data, share the stories behind their computations, and enable future collaboration and innovation.

# Installing Jupyter Notebook

## conda

```python
conda install -c conda-figure notebook
```

## pip

```python
pip install notebook
#or
pip install jupyter
```

- What is conda and pip?

    Conda and Pip is an open source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. They each quickly install, run, and update packages and their dependencies. They each easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local machine and both were created for Python programs, but can package and distribute software for any language.
